# Examples with Panda's Library
In this project is going to make an example with pandas' library in Python.

Will see the differences between Series and DataFrame:

  - **Series**: Is a unidimensional array with indexation. Similar to dictionary.
  - **DataFrame**: Data structure similar to excel or SQL table.
  

For this example i used the "MovieLens" data set that contains information of users, films and ratings. We see how transform the Movielens data set to a DataFrame, and work with this structure similarly to work as a database.
